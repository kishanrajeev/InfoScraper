# InfoScraper

This project is a simple script to scrape information from websites. It uses the `selenium` library to fetch and parse the webpage.

## Installation

Before running the script, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install requests selenium
```

## Usage

To use the script, simply run it with Python:

```bash
python Infoscraper.py
```

The script will prompt you for a name. After entering the name, the script will scrape the information from person entered and print it.

## Note

The script uses the `senelium` library to parse the HTML of the webpage.

## Error Handling

If you enter an invalid name or choose to exit the program, the script will print an error message and then prompt you to enter another name. If any other error occurs during the scraping process, the script will print an error message and exit.
